# 🚀 The Data Science Challenges

In this repository, I tackle 5 distinct industry scenarios. For each challenge, I have:
1.  **Generated my own mock data** (simulating the client's database).
2.  **Cleaned and Preprocessed** the raw data.
3.  **Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to solve specific business questions.

## 📈 Learning Outcomes

Through these challenges, I have demonstrated competency in:
* **Handling Ambiguity:** Creating datasets based on vague business requirements.
* **Data Cleaning:** Handling null values, fixing data types, and removing outliers.
* **Business Intelligence:** Translating raw Python outputs into actionable business advice (e.g., "Stop selling Item X in New York").
